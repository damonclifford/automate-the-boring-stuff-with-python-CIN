# automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python-CIN
This repo contains the Python script that automates the production of country information notes (CIN) by webscraping data from differents APIs (World Bank's WDI, Haver Analytics' DLX, OECD (SMDX-JSON) and UN COMTRADE APIs; performing all data preprocessing and transformations using Pandas library (hence veering away from Excel spreadsheet risks); and generating a clean report in Word (.docx) that follows that new CIN format.

Future improvements underway: Automating the writeup section which describes recent economic developments (quarterly growth analysis, analysis of high-frequency leading indicators (consumer confidence, retail sales, business sentiment, etc, monthly inflation analysis as well as FocusEconomics projections on GDP and inflation).
